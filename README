Current PDF.JS viewer is based on v1.6.210.

How to upgrade viewer:

0. Update the instructions below for new arrangement where pdfjs-embed is its own package!

1. Get pdf.js code, compile, and test:

  git clone https://github.com/mozilla/pdf.js.git
  cd pdf.js
  PDFJS=`pwd`   # saves path in environment variable for later
  git tag    # look for the version you want (usually the latest)
  git checkout TAG_YOU_WANT
  npm install
  gulp generic
  gulp server
  (browse to http://localhost:8888/web/viewer.html and verify that viewer works)

2. Copy and customize files

  cd path/to/your/jschol
  cd app/js/pdfjs
  rm pdf*.js compatibility.js l10n.js
  cp $PDFJS/build/generic/build/pdf*.js .
  cp $PDFJS/build/generic/web/{compatibility,l10n}.js .

  mv viewer.js viewer.old.js
  cp viewer.stock.js viewer.js
  cp $PDFJS/build/generic/web/viewer.js viewer.new.js
  (now do a 3-way diff between viewer.old.js, viewer.js, and viewer.new.js, merging
   changes into viewer.js)
  mv viewer.new.js viewer.stock.js
  rm viewer.old.js

  cd ../../scss/vendor/pdfjs
  mv _viewer.scss _viewer.old.scss
  cp _viewer.stock.scss _viewer.scss
  cp $PDFJS/build/generic/web/viewer.css _viewer.new.scss
  (edit _viewer.new.css and perform global changes:
    1. "images/" -> "/images/pdfjs/"
    2. "^(html\[[^\]]+] )" with "\1&"
  )
  (now do a 3-way diff between _viewer.old.scss, _viewer.scss, and _viewer.new.scss, merging
   changes into _viewer.scss)
  mv _viewer.new.scss _viewer.stock.scss
  rm _viewer.old.scss

  cd ../../../images/pdfjs
  rm *
  cp $PDFJS/build/generic/web/images/* .
  git add .

3. Test!
